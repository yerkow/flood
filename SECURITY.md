## Supported Versions

| Version                  | Supported          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| HEAD of master           | :white_check_mark: |

Flood does NOT provide LTS support. Older revisions are deprecated as soon as a newer revision is released.

Generally only the latest revision (`HEAD of master`) is supported. However, [issue tracker](https://github.com/jesec/flood/issues) is still open to reports from users of the `Latest released revision`. In rare circumstances, if there is a vulnerability that requires urgent attention, and, if the `HEAD of master` is occupied with changes which maintainers are not comfortable to release, relevant changes may be backported to the `Latest released revision` to release a patch revision.

You are advised to upgrade to the latest release as soon as possible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Suggestions for general security enhancements and/or mitigations shall be reported to [issue tracker](https://github.com/jesec/flood/issues).
